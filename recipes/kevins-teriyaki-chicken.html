        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My uncle has got to be one of the best cooks that I know. When we have a family get together, this dish is often requested.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups pineapple juice</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the pineapple juice, soy sauce, ginger, garlic powder, and white pepper. Reserve a small amount of the marinade separately for dipping later.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in marinade, and add enough water to cover. Cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Brush grate lightly with oil. Grill chicken 5 to 7 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Chicken is done when inside is no longer pink and juices run clear.</li>
        </ol>
